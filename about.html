        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a full stack developer specializing in creating seamless web
          experiences from front-end interfaces to back-end architecture. I have
          experience with various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          React, Python, Django, and database management systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on a range of
          projects, helping clients bring their ideas to life through effective
          and responsive web solutions. My passion lies in coding clean and
          maintainable systems that ensure scalability and performance. Outside
          of coding, I love learning about new technologies and improving my
          skill set.
        </p>
        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>
          As a developer, my mission is to deliver innovative solutions that
          align with client needs while maintaining a high level of usability,
          security, and performance.
